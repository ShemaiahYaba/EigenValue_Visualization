# Utility Functions/Helpers

The `utils` folder contains utility functions and helper modules used across the project. These utilities encapsulate reusable logic, simplify complex operations, and promote code modularity and maintainability.

Examples include:

- Type declarations (e.g., `ImageDeclaration.d.ts`)
- Mathematical computations
- Data transformations
- Other shared functionality supporting core application logic
