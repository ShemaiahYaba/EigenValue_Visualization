# React Router Configuration

The `routes` folder contains all the route definitions and components used for navigation within the application. Each file in this folder represents a specific route or a group of related routes.

## Folder Structure

- **`index.js`**: The main entry point for defining and exporting all routes.
- **`[route-name].js`**: Individual route files that define the components and logic for specific paths.

## Usage

1. Import the routes from the `index.js` file into your main application file.
2. Use the `React Router` components like `<Routes>` and `<Route>` to configure navigation.

This structure ensures modularity and scalability for managing application routes.
