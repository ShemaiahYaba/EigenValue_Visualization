# Prompt: Generate Chapter 3 â€“ Methodology for Mathematics Education Research Project

You are assisting a mathematics student developing a pedagogical tool designed to enhance conceptual understanding in linear algebra. The project centers on the visualization of key theoretical constructs such as **eigenvalues**, **eigenvectors**, **linear maps**, and their associated **geometric interpretations**, including **invariant subspaces**, **basis transformations**, **diagonalizability**, and **geometric vs. algebraic multiplicity**.

The primary goal of this research is **to evaluate whether interactive, mathematically accurate visualizations can foster deeper intuition and improved retention** of these abstract ideas, particularly among undergraduate students studying linear algebra.

Please write **Chapter 3: Methodology** of the research documentation, reflecting the following focus:

## ðŸ“˜ CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY â€” STRUCTURE AND EXPECTATIONS

### 3.1 Research Design

- Clearly define this as a **mixed-methods educational study**, with both quantitative and qualitative components.
- Justify the use of mixed methods within the context of mathematics education, where abstract reasoning and conceptual insight are central.
- Situate the study within a quasi-experimental framework, optionally including a comparison between students exposed to interactive geometric visualizations and those who learn through traditional lecture-based instruction.

### 3.2 Participants

- Describe the target participant group as students currently engaged in formal study of linear algebra (e.g., at the undergraduate level).
- Provide rationale for expected sample size and inclusion criteria.
- Address ethical considerations, including informed consent, voluntary participation, and protection of academic integrity.

### 3.3 Instrumentation

- Detail the instruments used to assess **conceptual understanding** and **intuitive grasp** of eigenstructure-related concepts:
  - **Pre- and post-instruction assessments** involving problem-solving and geometric reasoning (e.g., interpreting the action of a linear transformation on a set of basis vectors).
  - **Surveys or reflection forms** eliciting studentsâ€™ perceived clarity, confidence, and conceptual grasp.
  - Optional: open-ended prompts that encourage articulation of concepts like diagonalizability, eigenspaces, or geometric multiplicity.

### 3.4 Data Collection Procedures

- Describe how the visualization tool will be integrated into instructional time or independent learning.
- Outline a timeline for exposure, testing, and reflection.
- Clarify any contrasts between experimental and control groups, including how traditional content will be delivered.

### 3.5 Data Analysis Methods

- For **quantitative data**:
  - Use appropriate inferential statistics (e.g., paired t-tests or Wilcoxon tests) to measure gains in conceptual understanding.
  - Report descriptive statistics such as mean, variance, and normalized learning gain.
- For **qualitative data**:
  - Conduct **thematic analysis** to identify patterns in studentsâ€™ explanations, misconceptions, or breakthroughs related to eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix diagonalization.
  - Examine reflections or transcripts for evidence of deeper structural understanding (e.g., recognition of invariant subspaces or appreciation of the geometry of matrix actions).

### 3.6 Validity and Reliability

- Discuss the theoretical alignment of instruments with key learning outcomes in linear algebra (e.g., recognizing eigenvectors as directions preserved under a transformation).
- Describe any piloting of assessment tools, expert review of test content, or triangulation between quantitative and qualitative findings.

### 3.7 Ethical Considerations

- Ensure anonymity and confidentiality of all participants.
- Describe the process for obtaining ethics approval (if applicable), and note the voluntary nature of participation.
- Address fairness in instruction and access to learning materials across study groups.

### 3.8 Methodological Limitations

- Acknowledge limits to generalizability (e.g., sample size, context-specific instruction).
- Discuss possible biases such as novelty effects or variation in instructional delivery.
- Note constraints in quantifying intuitive understanding, despite efforts to measure conceptual growth.
