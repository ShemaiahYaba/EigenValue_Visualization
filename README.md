# Eigenvalue Visualization with MLAB

A graphical project that helps users intuitively understand the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors by visualizing their impact on linear transformations in 2D and 3D space. Built using MLAB (Matplotlib + NumPy) in Python.

## 📊 Overview

This tool provides interactive visualizations that demonstrate how eigenvectors define invariant directions under a matrix transformation, and how eigenvalues scale those vectors. It’s particularly useful for educational purposes in linear algebra and numerical analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- Visualize 2D and 3D linear transformations
- Plot eigenvectors and show their orientation and scaling
- Animate transformations applied to a vector space
- Custom matrix input (manual or random)
- Color-coded axis and vectors for clarity

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Matplotlib**
- **NumPy**

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eigenvalue-visualization.git
cd eigenvalue-visualization
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python eigen_visualizer.py
```

You will be prompted to either enter your own 2x2 matrix or generate a random one. Once the matrix is set, the transformation and its effect on eigenvectors will be visualized.
