# MatrixLAB: Interactive Eigenvalue & PCA Visualization

MatrixLAB is a modern educational web app that helps users intuitively explore the behavior of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and principal components through interactive visualizations in 2D and 3D. Designed for students and educators in linear algebra, data science, and machine learning.

## 📊 Overview

MatrixLAB lets you:

- Input or upload custom matrices and datasets
- Visualize linear transformations, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues in real time
- Explore the Power Method and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) with step-by-step insights
- See how data is projected onto principal components, with explained variance charts and scatter plots

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Matrix Input:** Manual entry, CSV upload, or sample data for instant experimentation
- **2D & 3D Graphing:** Zoom, pan, color-coded axes, and animated transformations
- **Eigenvalue/Eigenvector Visualization:** See invariant directions and scaling effects
- **Numerical Methods Playground:** Power Method iterations, error tracking, and true eigenvalue comparison
- **PCA Module:** Upload data, select number of principal components, view explained variance, and project data
- **Modern UI:** Responsive split layouts, scrollable panels, tooltips, and protected routes for user sessions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, Three.js
- **Backend:** Python (Flask), NumPy
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)
  You can get started at [mlab-inky.vercel.app](https://mlab-inky.vercel.app)

## 🧮 Example: Matrix Transformation

You can enter a matrix like

```latex
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
1 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
```

and see how it transforms vectors, with eigenvectors shown as invariant directions and eigenvalues as scaling factors.
